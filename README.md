# SearchforPlanet.org
[SearchforPlanet.org](https://www.s0earchforplanet.org) is a startpage that implements an algorithm capable of distributing all searches performed to search engines that fund humanitarian and environmental actions. Startpage doesn’t contain scripts, doesn’t store search keys, doesn’t perform usage analysis, doesn’t track or profile the user who uses it, doesn’t collect or share data with third parties. It’s the right way, in our opinion, to use the web for free and fund humanitarian and environmental actions at the same time.

Startpage is independent and is in no way connected to either the search engines we use for redirection or any other entity.
